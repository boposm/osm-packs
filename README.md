# OSM Mod Pack
A large file consisting of modpacks for Minecraft.

INTRODUCTION
------------

These are used only for Fabric (https://fabricmc.net/) and currently supports version 1.16.5. It is a good idea to have the Fabric API downloaded and installed alongside everything. The mods in the list in its entirety are all compatible with each other, but you don't have to use all of them as some of them are redundant. Personally, for a more immersive experience, I prefer to use Antique Atlas instead of the minimap. It has a very Legend of Zelda feel to it, and can add some RPG elements mixed in with Battle Towers, Better End & Nether, Immersive Portals, Repurposed Structers, and ReVamped Villages.

OPTIONS
-------

If you were to have these on a server, I can't find a way to make the options customizable for everyone which is unfortunate. I'd recommend keeping everything default until you start running into issues, or until something becomes difficult. The battle towers are relatively easy with multiple people, but solo they can get difficult if you don't have good gear. I was able to solo four floors right after spawning in and getting a cobblestone sword and some supplies for impromptu escapes.

WARNINGS
--------

If you wish to use these on a server or your own world, really in general, you will need to make a new world. The world generation from Oh The Biomes You'll Go paired alongside Repurposed Structures will drastically increase immersion, but also cause an issue if you use the "Stacked Worlds" generation type in the world generation menu. If you see the button for it, don't press it.

CONCLUSION
----------

All in all, this modpack exists only to bring some fun. You can use OptiFabric to add shaders on client side, and it'll look pretty darn good. I recommend BSL or SEUS. If you think of things you can add, feel free to. None of the mods are incompatible, and have no dependencies other than FabricAPI.
